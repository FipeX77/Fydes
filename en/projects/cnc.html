    <p class="long-description">
      This was a fun project for a U.S. client who wanted a custom keychain to celebrate running the NYC marathon. The keychain was split into two CNC-cut parts:

Front piece had engraved years and finish times, with an empty spot in the middle for a small emblem.

Back piece featured a detailed outline of Central Park and a cutout for a leather strap.

Both parts were designed to snap together using two magnets, so it holds firmly but can be taken apart if needed.

One of the main challenges was getting the magnet alignment just right in both DXF files — had to test the tolerances so they fit snugly after manufacturing. Also had to keep engraved text sharp and readable, while keeping everything manufacturable on a standard CNC laser.

I exported the whole thing as clean, layered DXF files, separating through-cuts and engravings for production. The client was super happy with how it turned out.

If you need custom CNC parts, personalized items, or layered assembly design, I’ve got you covered!
