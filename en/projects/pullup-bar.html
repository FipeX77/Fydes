    <p class="long-description">
      One of my clients reached out with a request to fully remodel their existing wall-mounted pull-up bar. The bar included four different grip positions and had been used regularly in a home gym, but they wanted an upgraded version with better ergonomics and a manufacturing-ready 3D model.

I carefully measured the original part and recreated the entire geometry in CAD, optimizing the design for strength, grip comfort, and wall mounting. I also refined the construction for potential CNC fabrication or welding, depending on the production method.

The final design is robust, accurate, and fully prepared for fabrication — a solid example of how I can reverse-engineer real-world gym equipment and enhance it for usability and production.
