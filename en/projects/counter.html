    <p class="long-description">
      For a sci-fi board game, I designed and engineered a mechanical dashboard that tracks fuel, settlers, and distance using 3 independent gear systems. Each system features custom gear ratios for modular and decimal counting (e.g. settlers in 7√ó25 format, distance up to 9999).

üìê In the preview images, you can see:

A working digital prototype modeled in CAD

A real-world 3D Printed version in action

One of many hand-drawn technical diagrams I used to finetune the gear placement and layer spacing

The final design uses a layered structure:

Bottom: hex-grid support plate

Middle: gear system (custom engraved indicators)

Top: engraved frame with labeled openings and player control knobs

‚öôÔ∏è Everything is functional: rotate knobs to change values, and all digits/mechanics update in sync. The design prioritizes playability, steampunk aesthetics, and manufacturing feasibility (tested with 3D print + laser cut plexi).

We went trough a lot of changes, but managed to make first functional version.

Need something similar? I can turn your game mechanic into a functional, interactive, physical device ready for prototyping or production.
