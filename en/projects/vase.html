    <p class="long-description">
Max reached out with a hand-drawn sketch of a large round vase and asked if I could turn it into a 3D-printable model within 24 hours. He had never ordered a CAD model before, so I guided him through the process step by step.

He provided 2 simple sketches, and based on those I modeled the full geometry with smooth transitions and proportional dimensions ‚Äì while also adapting it slightly for better 3D printability.

I delivered the model in STL, STEP, and 3MF formats, ready to be used with any online 3D printing service.

üìé In the portfolio you can see:

One of the original hand sketches

A second angle sketch with dimensions

A render preview of the final vase model

It was a simple but satisfying project, and a great example of how I help clients with zero CAD experience bring their ideas into reality ‚Äî quickly, clearly, and with manufacturability in mind.

Need a custom printable object? Even from just a rough sketch? Let‚Äôs make it happen.
